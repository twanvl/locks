Split key lock
==============

A lock that uses gears to move part of the key into contact with the pins. The pins are inaccessible from the outside, and therefore they cannot be picked. The parts of the key are held together by magnets.

The idea comes from this reddit post: https://old.reddit.com/r/lockpicking/comments/coigqa/could_you_pick_that_lock/


Printing instructions
------------------
Designed for 0.15mm layer heights. I used elephant's foot correction for the first layer. Some light sanding was needed to make everything fit together.

I designed the key for 4mm disc magnets that I had on hand. Pause the printing of the key at the appropriate layers to insert the magnets.

The springs should be printed in ABS or PETG, because PLA will very quickly deform permanently when under spring tension.
